\maketitle

\begin{abstract} 
Which properties of a molecule define its odor? This is a basic question of olfaction, 
yet to be answered. Human olfactory system has a repertoire of about 350 olfactory receptors. 
Molecules bind to them with different affinities and activate them with different efficacies, 
resulting in a combinatorial code that identifies odorants. 
We hypothesized that the binding affinity between a pair of odorant-receptor is affected by their relative sizes. 
The affinity can reaches its maximum if molecular volume of an odorant matches volume of a receptor's binding-pocket 
and it reach zero if the sizes are too different, 
obscuring the effect of other molecular properties. 
We formulated this hypothesis mathematically and verified it on Data of Drosophila, 
and predicted the volume and the structural flexibility of each receptor’s binding-site, 
which are significantly different among receptors. 
This provides a reason for differences in smell among similar molecules of different sizes. 
\end{abstract}



%\section*{Significance Statement}
%We perceive wavelength of light as its colors and frequency of sound as its pitch. But we don’t know yet what properties of molecules are perceived as smell. In this work, for the first time, we showed that molecular volume of an odorant is an important factor in the fruit fly. It affects two dimensions of smell: its intensity (weak or strong) and its quality (sweet, floral, fruity or etc). The molecular volume could describe the difference in the smell of methanol and butanol. Methanol smells pungent while butanol smells winy with a tad of banana like aroma.

\section*{Introduction}

%%%%%
I applied some combinations of test wells as baseline and see results of significancy of volume sensitivity in odorant receptors.
  
test well = 36 , data = data1 \&\ data2 , dens = 0 , ORs = 512:

sig= 74, fdr= 13, bon= 5.

test well = (36,48,60) , data = data1 , dens = 0 , ORs = 442:

sig= 124, fdr= 49, bon= 19.

test well = (72,84,96) , data = data1 , dens = 10 , ORs = 442:

sig= 71, fdr= 1, bon= 1.

test well = (12,24,36,48) , data = data2 , dens = 0 , ORs = 72:

sig= 2, fdr= 0, bon= 0.

test well = (60,72,84,96) , data = data2 , dens = 1 , ORs = 72:

sig= 0, fdr= 0, bon= 0.

test well = (36,48,60)(12,24,36,48) , data = data1 \&\ data2 , dens = 0 , ORs = 512:

sig= 123, fdr= 42, bon= 19.
