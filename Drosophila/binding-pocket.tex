\maketitle

\begin{abstract} 
Which properties of a molecule define its odor? This is a basic question of olfaction, 
yet to be answered. Human olfactory system has a repertoire of about 350 olfactory receptors. 
Molecules bind to them with different affinities and activate them with different efficacies, 
resulting in a combinatorial code that identifies odorants. 
We hypothesized that the binding affinity between a pair of odorant-receptor is affected by their relative sizes. 
The affinity can reaches its maximum if molecular volume of an odorant matches volume of a receptor's binding-pocket 
and it reach zero if the sizes are too different, 
obscuring the effect of other molecular properties. 
We formulated this hypothesis mathematically and verified it on Data of Drosophila, 
and predicted the volume and the structural flexibility of each receptor's binding-site, 
which are significantly different among receptors. 
This provides a reason for differences in smell among similar molecules of different sizes. 
\end{abstract}



%\section*{Significance Statement}
%We perceive wavelength of light as its colors and frequency of sound as its pitch. But we don’t know yet what properties of molecules are perceived as smell. In this work, for the first time, we showed that molecular volume of an odorant is an important factor in the fruit fly. It affects two dimensions of smell: its intensity (weak or strong) and its quality (sweet, floral, fruity or etc). The molecular volume could describe the difference in the smell of methanol and butanol. Methanol smells pungent while butanol smells winy with a tad of banana like aroma.

Survival of many species depends on their olfactory system. 
They use it  to find food, 
avoid poison, 
escape from danger, 
mate, 
and bind to their offspring.
An olfactory system detects volatile chemicals in the surrounding, 
encodes the results and transmit them to limbic system and cortex.

The front end of the olfactory system are olfactory receptor neurons.  
Each receptor neuron expresses only one kind of olfactory receptor (in insects many are co-expressed with Orco \cite{Larsson2004}).
Neurons of the same type converge into the same glomeruli of the olfactory bulb (or antenatal lobe in insects),
so that each glomerulus of olfactory bulb receives an amplified signal from only one type of olfactory receptor~\cite{root2007,Carey2011,Vosshall2000,Couto2005,fishilevich2005,gao2000,wang1998,mombaerts1996,vassar1994}.
%That makes the olfactory bulb (or antennal lobe in insects) the target of methods like calcium imaging (eg. ~\cite{Silbering2012}), 
%whereas electro-physiological studies directly target olfactory receptor neurons (eg.~\cite{Benton2010}). 

The olfactory systems use a combinatorial code: 
unlike many other receptors which are activated by only specific ligands (eq. neurotransmitters and hormones),
an olfactory receptor can be triggered by many odorant molecules, 
and an odorant molecule can interact with different olfactory receptors~\cite{Malnic2000},

The combinatorial code enables the olfactory system to discriminate trillion odors~\cite{Bushdid2014}.
However, it is not clear yet which properties of a molecule contribute to its smell. It is a topic of ongoing researches and there are many theories~\cite{Turin,Keller2004,Araneda2000,Brookes2007,Franco2011,Pelz2006,Gabler2013,Schmuker2007,Haddad2008,Snitz2013,Yablonka2012,gane2013}.

In this study, 
we investigated the relation between molecular volumes of odorants and the responses of olfactory receptor neurons. 
Our results suggest that molecular volume is a considerable factor, 
but not the only factor that determines the neural response of the olfactory receptor neurons.

The olfactory receptors are transmembrane proteins.
In vertebrates, they are metabotropic receptors, they belong to the family of g-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). 
Linda B. Buck and Richard Axel won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, in 2004, 
for its discovery ~\cite{Buck1991}.
There are many similarities between the olfactory system of insects and vertebrates~\cite{Wilson2014,Kaupp2010}, 
and it was assumed that insects use the same kind of signal transduction~\cite{Brody2000,Hill04102002}. 
But recently, it has been argued that the olfactory receptors in insects are ionotropic~\cite{Sato2008,Wicher2008,Nagel2011,Rong2011}, 	
their topology is different from vertebrates~\cite{Benton2006,Smart2008},
and most of them function in presence of another common receptor, called Orco~\cite{Larsson2004}.


Regardless of the signal transduction, 
all olfactory receptor have the same function, they have a binding-pocket (also known as binding-cavity and binding-site),
where the ligands (odorants) bind to. 
Binding to an odorant activates an OR and 
the activated OR changes the potential of the cell, 
directly (ionotropic) or indirectly (metabotropic).

The amount of change in the membrane potential of an olfactory receptor neuron depends on the number of activated olfactory receptors and the time that they remain activated,
which are determined by various physio-chemical properties of the ligand (odorant) and the OR~\cite{Turin,Araneda2000,Gabler2013,guerrieri2005,uchida2000}. 
But here we focus on two properties: the volume and the flexibility of the binding-pocket.
The molecular volume of a ligand should match the dimensions of the binding-pocket of the OR,
then it fits into the binding-pocket of the OR and triggers the signal transduction. 
Any mismatch in the volumes will affect the neural responses, 
on the other hand the flexibility of the binding-pocket can compensate for the volume mismatch (Fig. \ref{fig:binding-pocket}).

We could know the volume and flexibility of the binding-pocket, 
if we knew its three dimensional structure.
But this is not the case here, 
as it is not easy to know the structure of integral proteins~\cite{Zhang2008,Lupieri2009}, 
including olfactory receptors. 
This is the topic of ongoing researches, 
using various methods like Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations, 
mutagenesis studies, heterologus expression studies, and homology modeling~\cite{Khafizov2007,Man2004,Lai2005,Vaidehi2002,Floriano2004,Schmiedeberg2007,Katada2005,Kato2008,Rospars2013}.
In this study, we predict the {\it in-vivo} volume and flexibility of binding-pocket of olfactory receptors, by applying our mathematical method to neural data from DoOR database~\cite{Galizia2010}. 

We suggest a functional relation between molecular volume and the neural responses, 
we provide a methodology to estimate {\it molecular receptive range} or {\it tuning function} of olfactory receptors,
and then we predict the structural properties of the binding-pocket of olfactory receptor - the volume and the flexibility of binding-pocket.
Our results may help to select odorants  for new experimental studies, 
may provide additional information about the structure of olfactory receptors to structural biologists, 
and may contribute to the study of olfactory coding.

To perform this study we use a public domain, 
well structured database -- DoOR -- 
that includes the neural responses of most olfactory receptors (OR) of \textit{Drosophila} to many odorants~\cite{Galizia2010}. 
This database aggregated data from many sources~\cite{Bruyne1999,Bruyne2001,Dobritsa2003,Goldman2005,Hallem2004,Hallem2006,
Kreher2005,Kreher2008,Kwon2007,Pelz2006,Pelz2006,Schmuker2007,Stensmyr2003,
Turner2009,VanderGoesvanNaters2007,Yao2005}.

%There are many studies that tries to connect physio-chemical properties of molecules to their perceived smells, like the current work, which studies the effect of molecular volume of odorants on the response of olfactory receptors.

%The olfactory system of insects are similar to the olfactory system of vertebrates in many ways ...  However, there are also differences .... 

%Some receptors respond to few molecules, some response to many.

%Insects receptors neurons show spontaneos activity of 8 Hz.

%Drosophila's olfactory receptors are ionotropic. They may be metabotropic. It is under debate.

% They have seven trans-membrane domains. They need Or83b to work. 
% they may construct a complex that work as a cation channel or Or83b functions as cation channel and collaborte with Olfactory receptor.

%we find that Drosophila ORs and OR83b adopt a novel membrane topology with their N-termini and the most conserved loops in the cytoplasm.~\cite{Benton2006}

%We find that major components of olfaction, including olfactory receptors (ORs), olfactory-related adenylate cyclase (AC3) and the olfactory G protein (G olf), are expressed in the kidney.~\cite{Pluznick2009}
 
%Most Drosophila olfactory neurons express two types of odorant receptor genes: Or83b, a broadly expressed receptor of unknown function, and one or more members of a family of 61 selectively expressed receptors.~\cite{Larsson2004}
 
%Humans can discriminate several million different colors and almost half a million different tones,On the basis of the results of psychophysical testing, we calculated that humans can discriminate at least 1 trillion olfactory stimuli.~\cite{Bushdid2014}

	\label{fig:hist-volumes}
\end{figure}

We studied the relation between neural responses and molecular volumes, 
We took the neural data of DoOR database \cite{Galizia2010} and we calculated molecular volume (supplemental file odorants.csv) using a computational chemistry software -- VEGA ZZ~\cite{Pedretti2004}. 
We used  GNU R to analyze the data~\cite{Rlanguage}.

DoOR database includes an $N\times M$ matrix. 
Its elements, $r_{nm}$, are the response of neuron $n$ to odorant $m$. 
This matrix is normalized between 0 and 1 so $0 \le r_{nm} \le 1$, where 1 is the strongest response.
This matrix has many {\it Not Available} (NA) values, 
and different neurons are excited by different set of odorants, 
We took care of this by removing NAs from the summations and calculating $\sum_{m: r_{nm} \neq \text{NA}}$, 
but for brevity, we used the usual notation $\sum_m$.

The response $r_{nm}$ depends on the molecular volume of the odorant, $v_m$, 
and other physio-chemical properties of the molecule $m$; 
We separated the response $r_{nm}$ into two terms:

\begin{equation}
	r_{nm} = f_n(v_m) \psi_{nm}.
	\label{eqn:factors}
\end{equation}
The first term, $f_n(v_m)$, depended only on the molecular volume of odorants.
The second term, $\psi_{nm}$ included every other influential properties of molecules, but the molecular volume.
Both terms were characteristic of each OR, and they varied from OR to OR.
In fact, the first term, $f_n(v)$, was the tuning curve of neuron $n$ in respect to the molecular volumes, 
it could be approximated with a Gaussian function

\begin{equation}
	\displaystyle f_n(v) = e^{-\frac{(v-v_n)^2}{2\sigma^2_n}}, 
	\label{eqn:volume-dependence}
\end{equation}
where, $v_n$ was the preferred molecular volume of OR $n$ and $\sigma_n$ represented its flexibility. 
In this work we wanted to estimate $v_n$ and $\sigma_n$. 
To do so, first we calculated the response weighted average of molecular volumes, 
$\frac{\sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\sum_{m} r_{nm}}$ and then we use (\ref{eqn:factors}):

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m f_n(v_m) \psi_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} f_n(v_m) \psi_{nm}}.
	\label{eqn:sta}
\end{equation}
Here we could approximate $\sum$ with $\int$, which is common in statistical physics:

\begin{equation}
	\sum_{m} \dots f_n(v_m) \psi_{nm} \approx  \langle \psi_{nm} \rangle_m \int_0^\infty \dots f_n(v) g(v)  dv. 
	\label{eqn:sigma_to_int}
\end{equation}
In which, 
$\langle \psi_{nm} \rangle_m$ denoted the average of $\psi_{nm}$ over all $m: r_{nm} \neq \text{NA}$. 
It could be moved out of the integral for it was independent of $v$.
In the above equation, 
$g(v)$ was the density of states, $g(v) dv$ indicated how many molecules have a molecular volume in the range of $v$ and $v+dv$.
This function was approximated by a Gaussian function, Fig.\ref{fig:hist-volumes}, 

\begin{equation}
	g(v) = e^{-\frac{(v- v_{g})^2}{2 \sigma_{g}^2}},
	\label{eqn:hist-volumes}
\end{equation}
ideally, $g(v)$ must not depend on the OR $n$ for it is the property of ensemble of odorant molecules, not ORs. 
But here, we had many missing values ($r_{nm} = NA$), 
so we had to calculate $g(v)$ for each neuron separately; 
Therefore, $v_{g_n}$ and $\sigma_{g_n}$ were the average and standard deviation of molecular volume while $r_{nm} \neq \text{NA}$.
We rewritten equation (\ref{eqn:sta}) using equation (\ref{eqn:sigma_to_int}):

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} \approx \frac{\displaystyle \int v f_n(v) g_n(v) dv}{\displaystyle \int f_n(v) g_n(v) dv}.
	\label{eqn:sta_int}
\end{equation}
We replaced the product of $f_n(v)$ and $g_n(v)$ in the above equation with $h_n(v) = f_n(v) g_n(v)$, to make a simpler form

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} \approx \frac{\displaystyle \int_v v h_n(v) dv}{ \displaystyle \int_v  h_n(v) dv }.
	\label{eqn:mean}
\end{equation}
The function $h_n(v)$ was a Gaussian function because it was the product of two Gaussian functions, 

\begin{equation}
h_n(v) = e^{-\frac{(v-\mu_{h_n})^2}{2\sigma_{h_n}^2}}, 
\end{equation}
so the right hand side of equation \ref{eqn:mean} was nothing but $\mu_{h_n}$ and 
in a similar way, we calculated $\sigma_{h_n}$ from the neural data

\begin{eqnarray}
	\mu_{h_n} &\approx& \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} \\
	\sigma_{h_n}^2 &\approx& \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m^2 r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} - \mu_{h_n}^2
	\label{eqn:final_h}
\end{eqnarray}


We knew the mean $v_{g_n}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{g_n}$ of $g_n(v)$ from the molecular volumes of the ensembles of odorants. 
We calculated the mean $\mu_{h_n}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{h_n}$ of $h_n(v)$ from the neural data.
Using them, we calculated the mean $v_n$ and the standard deviation $\sigma_n$ of $f_n(v)$:
first we calculate $\sigma_n$ from 

\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{\sigma_n^2} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2_{h_n}}  - \frac{1}{\sigma^2_{g_n}}
\end{equation}
and then we calculate $v_n$: 

\begin{equation}
	\frac{v_n}{\sigma_n^2}  =    \frac{\mu_{h_n}}{\sigma^2_{h_n}} - \frac{v_{g_n}}{\sigma^2_{g_n}}.
\end{equation}
The calculated $v_n$ and $\sigma_n$ were put in supplemental file volume-profiles.csv. 
The resulting $f_n(v)$ were plotted over the actual data, for \numberofreceptors odorant receptors (Fig.~\ref{fig:vol-res}),
in which p-values $<0.05$. 

We calculated p-values by permutation test. 
The alternative hypothesis was
``{\it The response of olfactory receptor neurons depend on the molecular volume of odorants.}'', 
which required  a finite value for $\sigma_n$, 
then the null hypothesis was 
``{\it The response of olfactory receptor neurons is independent of molecular volume of odorants.}'',
which required $\sigma_n \rightarrow \infty$, 
so p-value was the probability of having $\sigma'_n\leq\sigma_n$, 
where $\sigma_n$ was calculated from the original data, but $\sigma'_n$ calculated using permuted version.

We were testing a hypothesis on $\sim$60 ORs simultaneously. 
If we used a simple threshold of 0.05 for the p-value of each OR, we could have false positives. 
To address this issue, multiple-comparison problem, 
we used Bonferroni correction. 
The problem with Bonferroni correction is that it may increases false negatives.
This problem can be addressed using another method -- False Discovery Rate (FDR).
We used both methods -- Bonferroni and FDR, as well as no correction. 
The result were labeled accordingly in Fig.\ref{fig:vol-res}.

We also wanted to show the diversity of volume and flexibility of binding pocket among ORs.
To estimate the p-values, 
we took any pair of ORs that was sensitive to molecular volume (\numberofreceptors ORs),
calculate their difference, 
used a permutation test and measured the probability of being different only by chance (Fig.~\ref{fig:p-values}).

%Now we know the preferred volume $v_n$ of each receptor and also its flexibility $\sigma_n$.

There are two main assumption in this work: 
First we assumed that the response of an olfactory receptor can be factorized into two terms, 
according to (\ref{eqn:factors}).
Second, we assumed that the volume dependence factor $f_n(v_m)$ in (\ref{eqn:factors}) 
have a Gaussian form (Eq. \ref{eqn:volume-dependence}).
Considering the physics and chemistry behind the binding-process (Fig. \ref{fig:binding-pocket}), 
and the neural responses (Fig. \ref{fig:vol-res}), 
these assumptions are logical. 

%but, to be sure, we also put them in a test. 
%After calculating function $f_n(v)$ for each olfactory receptor, we can calculate $\psi_{nm}$ of the equation \ref{eqn:factors}.
%If $\psi_{nm}$ is independent of molecular volumes, it means that the assumptions where justified.

The function $f_n(v)$ can be considered as the tuning curve of olfactory receptor $n$ in response to molecular volume (Fig.~\ref{fig:vol-res}). 
Each OR has a preferred molecular volume $v_n$ and shows some flexibility $\sigma_n$. 
The calculated $f_n(v)$ are in  Fig.~\ref{fig:vol-res}. 
It includes \numberofreceptors ORs, 
which show a significant dependence to molecular volume of odorants in their response (p-value $<0.05$).

To address the multiple comparison problem, 
we also calculated the level of significance according to both Bonferroni (very conservative) and FDR (less conservative) corrections. 
From the results of \numberofreceptors ORs, 
\bonferroni of them are significant according to Bonferroni correction (OR name in italic), 
\fdr of them are significant according to FDR correction 
(OR name in bold), 
and the rest (\nocorrection ORs), 
only satisfy the criteria of  p-value $<0.05$, without any corrections.
Considering the FDR correction, 
we can conclude that nearly half of ORs (\fdr / 60 ) show significant sensitivity toward molecular volumes. 
The other half could be sensitive to molecular volume as well, but the current evidence are not enough and
more experiments are necessary.

The parameters of $f_n(v)$, $v_n$ and $\sigma_n$ are in Fig. \ref{fig:preferred_volume}.
Figure \ref{fig:preferred_volume} demonstrate that the molecular volume preference of ORs are different (top). 
and the flexibility of ORs are also different (bottom).
To backup these claims, 
we estimated the p-values of having different volume preference and flexibility for each pairs of \numberofreceptors ORs
(Fig.~\ref{fig:p-values}). 
From all possible 378 pairs, 
when comparing the volume preferences, 
133 have a p-value of less than 0.05, 
this number reduces to 89 after using FDR and further reduces to 32 using Bonferroni correction.
When comparing flexibilities, 
the numbers become 168, 134 and 77 respectively. 
The union of these two set says that 226 (p-value $<0.05$), 171 (FDR corrected), and 91 (Bonferroni corrected) pairs of ORs showed distinct differences in their binding-pocket characteristics.

This diversity is important in perceiving the quality of smells. 
In a hypothetical experiment, 
assume that every characteristic of odorant molecules are the same but their molecular volume.
If all olfactory receptors had the same preferred volume and flexibility, 
any change in the molecular volume would change only the intensity of smell not its quality.
But olfactory receptors have different preferred volumes and flexibilities, 
so any change in the molecular volume of an odorant results in a different combinatorial encoding which affects the quality of perceived smell as well its intensity.
This agrees with the work of M. Zarzo: larger molecules  smell better~\cite{zarzo2011}.
That may describe the difference in the smell of methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol. 
Methanol smells pungent, ethanol smells pleasant and winy, propanol and butanol smell like ethanol except butanol  has a little banana like aroma.
The molecular volume affects the combinatorial encoding, 
and the combinatorial code determines the quality of odorants.

Here we showed that the responses of olfactory receptor neurons are related to the molecular volume of odorants, 
apart from that, it is not clear which other features of molecules are measured by olfactory receptors. 
There are many works that try to connect the physio-chemical properties of molecules to the evoked neural response or perceived smells.
But the non-linear volume dependence (Eq. \ref{eqn:factors} and Eq. \ref{eqn:volume-dependence})  
may mask important relations between molecules and neural responses.
When $f_n(v)$ is zero or close to zero, 
the value of $\psi_{nm}$ does not matter. 

We predict odorants with a molecular volume on the tails of $f_n(v)$ goes undetected, 
regardless of any other physio-chemical properties that they may have. 
This prediction can be confirmed in furthur experiments. 

To better study $\psi_{nm}$ of an OR, 
it is better to have many data points and those data points are better to be around the preferred volume of the OR.
But this is not the case in current data. 
For many ORs, 
most data points are on the tails of $f_n(v)$, which is close to zero.
We have suggested the best selection of odorants for each of \numberofreceptors studied ORs 
(see Venn diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:odorant-suggest} and supplemental file proposed-odorants.csv), 
saving time and expenses of future experiments. 

%After gathering enough data, 
%by considering the effect of molecular volume on the response of olfactory receptor neurons, 
%one might discover more subtle dependence between other molecular features and neural responses, 
%by investigating $\psi_{nm}$, 
%which otherwise would be masked by this non-linear relation $f_n(v)$.

We also predict some {\it in-vivo} structural aspects of  the binding-pocket of olfactory receptors:
the preferred volume of each OR results from the volume of the binding-pocket,
the flexibility of an OR results from the rigidity or flexibility of the binding-pocket; 
%Therefore, our results provides information about both structural and dynamical properties of olfactory receptors in Drosophila. 
These data add some constrains over the 3d structure of olfactory receptors, 
which may help the prediction and calculation of 3d structure of these proteins. 

The method of this work can be combined with mutagenesis as well. 
Some genes of an olfactory receptor are mutated, 
then its response to a selection of molecules are measured and finally the preferred volume and flexibility are calculated.
In this way we can understand which amino acids of the olfactory receptor contribute to the volume and flexibility of the binding-pocket, 
as well as affecting the function of the ORs.

There is one possible improvment to this work. Approximating $f_n(v)$ and $g(v)$ with a Gaussian function makes the mathematical formulation simple and readable. 
But a semi-infinite function may be a better choice for molecular volumes which can not have negative values.

Although this work is on the data of \textit{Drosophila}, 
we expect that the general principles and methodologies of this work hold for vertebrates as well. 
But considering the similarities and dissimilarities between insects and vertebrate, 
this should be verified.
