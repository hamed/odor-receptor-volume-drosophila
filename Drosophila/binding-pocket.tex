\begin{abstract} 
Which properties of a molecule define its odor? This is a basic question of olfaction, 
yet to be answered. Olfactory system of \textit{Drosophila} has a repertoire of about 60 odorant receptors. 
Molecules bind to them with different affinities and activate them with different efficacies, 
resulting in a combinatorial code that identifies the odorants. 
We hypothesized that the binding affinity between a pair of odorant-receptor is affected by their relative sizes. 
The affinity can reach its maximum if the molecular volume of an odorant matches the volume of a binding-pocket 
and it drops to zero if the sizes are too different, 
obscuring the effect of other molecular properties. 
We formulated this hypothesis mathematically and verified it on the data of \textit{Drosophila}, 
and predicted the volume and the structural flexibility of the binding-site of each odorant receptor, 
which are significantly different among odorant receptors. 
This provides a reason for the smell differences of similar molecules with different sizes.

%\section*{Significance Statement}
%We perceive wavelength of light as its colors and frequency of sound as its pitch. But we don’t know yet what properties of molecules are perceived as smell. In this work, for the first time, we showed that molecular volume of an odorant is an important factor in the fruit fly. It affects two dimensions of smell: its intensity (weak or strong) and its quality (sweet, floral, fruity or etc). The molecular volume could describe the difference in the smell of methanol and butanol. Methanol smells pungent while butanol smells winy with a tad of banana like aroma.

%Survival of many species depends on their olfactory system. 
%They use it  to find food, 
%avoid poison, 
%escape from danger, 
%mate, 
%and bind to their offspring.
%An olfactory system detects volatile chemicals in the surrounding, 
%encodes the results and transmit them to limbic system and cortex.

We know that which properties of the light are measured by our eyes and how our eyes do that. 
That knowledge assisted the production of cameras and displays. 
Unfortunately we do not have the same knowledge in olfaction, 
we do not know the relation between the stimuli --molecular properties-- and sensory experiences --the quality of smells.  

%Molecules of a volatile material evaporates into air, 
%the concentration of the vapor depends on the vapor pressure of the material and its temperature, 
%the vapor reaches sensilla of the insect (epithelium in human), 
%depending on their solubility in water, they enter sensillum lymph (mucosa in human), 
%and the odorant binding protein may also help them to reach odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) and bind to their odorant receptors (ORs). 

olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are  the front end of the olfactory system.
Each ORN expresses only one kind of OR. 
% (in insects many are co-expressed with Orco \cite{Larsson2004}).
ORNs of the same type converge into the same glomeruli of antennal lobe in insects (or the olfactory bulb in human)
%so that each glomerulus receives an amplified signal from only one type of OR
~\cite{root2007,Carey2011,Vosshall2000,Couto2005,fishilevich2005,gao2000,wang1998,mombaerts1996,vassar1994}.
%That makes the olfactory bulb (or antennal lobe in insects) the target of methods like calcium imaging (eg. ~\cite{Silbering2012}), 
%whereas electro-physiological studies directly target olfactory receptor neurons (eg.~\cite{Benton2010}). 

The olfactory system uses a combinatorial code: 
unlike many other receptors which are activated by only one specific ligand -- a neurotransmitter or a hormone,
an OR can be triggered by many odorant molecules, 
and an odorant molecule can interact with different OR types~\cite{Malnic2000},
The combinatorial code enables humans to discriminate many odors~\cite{Bushdid2014} by using a repertoire of only about 350 ORs.
However, it is not clear yet which properties of a molecule contribute to its smell. 
It is a topic of ongoing researches and there are many theories~\cite{Turin,Keller2004,Araneda2000,Brookes2007,Franco2011,Pelz2006,Gabler2013,Schmuker2007,Haddad2008,Snitz2013,Yablonka2012,gane2013,
turin2015plausibility,block2015implausibility,vosshall2015laying}.

The ORs are transmembrane proteins, 
in insects they are ionotropic~\cite{Sato2008,Wicher2008,Nagel2011,Rong2011}, 
their topology is different from vertebrates~\cite{Benton2006,Smart2008},
and most of them function in the presence of another common receptor, called Orco~\cite{Larsson2004}.
Whereas in vertebrates, they are metabotropic receptors, that belong to the family of g-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)~\cite{Buck1991,niimura2009evolutionary}. 

There are many similarities between the olfactory system of insects and vertebrates~\cite{Wilson2014,Kaupp2010}.
Regardless of the signal transduction, 
all ORs have the same function: they have a binding-pocket (also known as binding-cavity and binding-site),
where odorants (ligands) bind to. 
Binding to an odorant activates an OR and 
the activated OR changes the potential of the cell, 
directly (ionotropic in insects) or indirectly (metabotropic in vertebrates);
Therefore, what we learn from olfactory system of \textit{Drosophila} could help us to decode human olfaction. 

%and it was assumed that insects use the same kind of signal transduction~\cite{Brody2000,Hill04102002}. 

The amount of change in the membrane potential of an ORN depends on the number of activated ORs and the time that they remain activated,
which are determined by various physio-chemical properties of the odorant and the OR~\cite{Turin,Araneda2000,Gabler2013,guerrieri2005,uchida2000}.
One important factor is the relative size of the ligand and the OR's binding pocket. 
This has been used in the computational drug design as a predictor of binding pocket for a given ligand~\cite{liang1998anatomy}. 
Another factor is the flexibility of the binding pocket. 
Proteins are not rigid bodies,  
and they can change shape, 
depending on the amino acids involved~\cite{Ramachandran,apostolakis1998docking,gunasekaran2007different}.

%% This can be changed. %%  https://bitbucket.org/allaei/odor-receptor-volume/issues/36/
Therefore, here we focused on the volume and the flexibility of the binding-pocket.
The molecular volume of a ligand should match the dimensions of the binding-pocket of the OR,
then it fits into the binding-pocket of the OR and triggers the signal transduction. 
Any mismatch in the volume will decrease the neural responses, 
on the other hand the flexibility of the binding-pocket can compensate for the volume mismatch (Fig. \ref{fig:binding-pocket}).
%%

We could know the volume and flexibility of the binding-pocket, 
if we knew its three dimensional structure. 
But this is not the case here, 
as it is not easy to know the structure of integral proteins~\cite{Zhang2008,Lupieri2009}, 
including ORs. 
This is the topic of ongoing researches, 
using various methods like Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations, 
mutagenesis studies, heterologus expression studies, and homology modeling~\cite{Khafizov2007,Man2004,Lai2005,Vaidehi2002,Floriano2004,Schmiedeberg2007,Katada2005,Kato2008,Rospars2013}.

In this study, 
we develop a mathematical framework to put the available experimental data in the best use and
investigated the relation between molecular volume of odorants and the responses of ORNs. 
Our results suggest that molecular volume is a considerable factor, 
but not the only factor that determines the neural response of the ORNs.
We predicted the {\it in-vivo} volume and flexibility of binding-pocket of ORs (supplemental file volume-profiles.csv), 
by applying our mathematical method to neural data from DoOR database~\cite{Galizia2010}, 
which is a well structured database that includes the neural responses of most ORs of \textit{Drosophila} to many odorants~\cite{Galizia2010}. 
This database aggregated data from many sources~\cite{Bruyne1999,Bruyne2001,Dobritsa2003,Goldman2005,Hallem2004,Hallem2006,
Kreher2005,Kreher2008,Kwon2007,Pelz2006,Pelz2006,Schmuker2007,Stensmyr2003,
Turner2009,VanderGoesvanNaters2007,Yao2005}.

We suggested a functional relation between molecular volume and the neural responses, 
we provided a methodology to estimate the {\it molecular receptive range} or {\it tuning function} of ORs,
and then we predicted the structural properties of the binding-pocket of OR - the volume and the flexibility of binding-pocket.
Our results may help to select odorants  for new experimental studies (supplemental file proposed-odorants.csv), 
%may provide additional information about the structure of ORs to structural biologists, 
and may contribute to the study of olfactory coding by unmasking the effect of other possible factors.

%%
%There are many studies that tries to connect physio-chemical properties of molecules to their perceived smells, like the current work, which studies the effect of molecular volume of odorants on the response of odorant receptors.

%The olfactory system of insects are similar to the olfactory system of vertebrates in many ways ...  However, there are also differences .... 

%Some receptors respond to few molecules, some response to many.

%Insects receptors neurons show spontaneos activity of 8 Hz.

%Drosophila's odorant receptors are ionotropic. They may be metabotropic. It is under debate.

% They have seven trans-membrane domains. They need Or83b to work. 
% they may construct a complex that work as a cation channel or Or83b functions as cation channel and collaborte with odorant receptor.

%we show that the Drosophila melanogaster male-specific pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) acts through the receptor Or67d to regulate both male and female mating behaviour. ~\cite{Kurtovic2007}
%we show that a Drosophila melanogaster CD36 homologue, Sensory neuron membrane protein (SNMP), is expressed in a population of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) implicated in pheromone detection.~\cite{Benton2007}
 
%we find that Drosophila ORs and OR83b adopt a novel membrane topology with their N-termini and the most conserved loops in the cytoplasm.~\cite{Benton2006}

%We find that major components of olfaction, including olfactory receptors (ORs), olfactory-related adenylate cyclase (AC3) and the olfactory G protein (G olf), are expressed in the kidney.~\cite{Pluznick2009}
 
%Most Drosophila olfactory neurons express two types of odorant receptor genes: Or83b, a broadly expressed receptor of unknown function, and one or more members of a family of 61 selectively expressed receptors.~\cite{Larsson2004}
 
%Humans can discriminate several million different colors and almost half a million different tones,On the basis of the results of psychophysical testing, we calculated that humans can discriminate at least 1 trillion olfactory stimuli.~\cite{Bushdid2014}

		which is slightly different from  the mean.}
	\label{fig:hist-volumes}
\end{figure}
%We studied the relation between neural responses and molecular volumes, 
We took the neural data of DoOR 1.0 database \cite{Galizia2010}, hold out the additional data of DoOR 2.0 as a test set \cite{muench2015door,
de2010,dweck2015,dweck2013,marshall2010,montague2011,Gabler2013}. 
We calculated molecular volume (supplemental file odorants.csv) using a computational chemistry software -- VEGA ZZ~\cite{Pedretti2004}. 
We used  GNU R to analyze the data~\cite{Rlanguage}.

DoOR database includes an $N\times M$ matrix. 
Its elements, $r_{nm}$, are the response of olfactory receptor neuron $n$ to odorant $m$. 
This matrix is normalized between 0 and 1 so $0 \le r_{nm} \le 1$, where 1 is the strongest response.
This matrix has many {\it Not Available} (NA) values, 
and different ORNs are excited by different set of odorants. 
We took care of this by removing NAs from the summations and calculating $\sum_{m: r_{nm} \neq \text{NA}}$, 
but for brevity, we used the usual notation $\sum_m$.

The response $r_{nm}$ may depend on the molecular volume of the odorant, $v_m$, 
and other physio-chemical properties of the molecule $m$; 
thus we separated the response $r_{nm}$ into two terms:

%% This can be changed. %%  https://bitbucket.org/allaei/odor-receptor-volume/issues/36/
\begin{equation}
	r_{nm} = f_n(v_m) \psi_{nm}.
	\label{eqn:factors}
\end{equation}
The first term, $f_n(v_m)$, depends only on the molecular volume of odorants.
The second term, the volume independent term $\psi_{nm}$, included every other influential properties of molecules, 
but the molecular volume or any other properties that correlates to molecular volume (eg, molecular weight).
Among all the molecular parameter that correlate with molecular volume, 
we used molecular volume because it fits to the acceptable picture of protein-ligand interaction (Fig. \ref{fig:binding-pocket}).
If we used molecular weight it would imply that some sort of mass spectroscopy is going on. 
There are other important parameters, like polarity, functional group, polar surface area and many others, 
we have tried out a few of them, but none of them were as dominant as molecular volume. 
Thus we focused on the molecular volume ($f_n(v)$) and leaved others parameters ($\psi_nm$) for the future studies.
%%%%%

%% This can be changed. %%  https://bitbucket.org/allaei/odor-receptor-volume/issues/36/
Both terms were characteristic of each OR, and they varied from OR to OR.
In fact, the first term, $f_n(v)$, can be considered as the tuning curve of olfactory receptor neuron $n$ with respect to the molecular volumes. 
We approximate it with a Gaussian function,  
\begin{equation}
	\displaystyle f_n(v) = e^{-\frac{(v-v_n)^2}{2\sigma^2_n}}, 
	\label{eqn:volume-dependence}
\end{equation}
where, $v_n$ is the preferred molecular volume of OR $n$ and $\sigma_n$ represents its flexibility. 
We used a Gaussian function for the tuning curve, because (a) it is among the simplest form that can describe a preferred  volume and a flexibility, 
(b) the mathematics is easy to follow and the final solution is simple.

In this work we wanted to estimate $v_n$ and $\sigma_n$. 
To do so, first we calculate the response weighted average of molecular volumes, 
$\frac{\sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\sum_{m} r_{nm}}$ and then we use (\ref{eqn:factors}):
%%%

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m f_n(v_m) \psi_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} f_n(v_m) \psi_{nm}}.
	\label{eqn:sta}
\end{equation}
We approximate $\sum$ with $\int$, which is common in statistical physics:

\begin{equation}
	\sum_{m} \dots f_n(v_m) \psi_{nm} \approx  \langle \psi_{nm} \rangle_m \int_0^\infty \dots f_n(v) g(v)  dv. 
	\label{eqn:sigma_to_int}
\end{equation}
In which, 
$\langle \psi_{nm} \rangle_m$ denotes the average of $\psi_{nm}$ over all $m: r_{nm} \neq \text{NA}$. 
We moved it out of the integral as it is independent of $v$.
Here $g(v)$ was the density of states, $g(v) dv$ indicate how many molecules have a molecular volume in the range of $v$ and $v+dv$.
This function was approximated by a Gaussian function (Fig.~\ref{fig:hist-volumes}), 

\begin{equation}
	g(v) = e^{-\frac{(v- v_{g})^2}{2 \sigma_{g}^2}},
	\label{eqn:hist-volumes}
\end{equation}
ideally, $g(v)$ must not depend on the OR $n$ as it is the property of the ensemble of odorant molecules, not ORs. 
But here, we have many missing values ($r_{nm} = NA$) that are not overlapping, 
so we have to calculate $g(v)$ for each ORN separately; 
Therefore, $v_{g_n}$ and $\sigma_{g_n}$ are the average and standard deviation of molecular volume while $r_{nm} \neq \text{NA}$.
We have rewritten equation (\ref{eqn:sta}) using equation (\ref{eqn:sigma_to_int}):

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} \approx \frac{\displaystyle \int v f_n(v) g_n(v) dv}{\displaystyle \int f_n(v) g_n(v) dv}.
	\label{eqn:sta_int}
\end{equation}
To make a simpler form we replace the product of $f_n(v)$ and $g_n(v)$ in the above equation with $h_n(v) = f_n(v) g_n(v)$.

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} \approx \frac{\displaystyle \int_v v h_n(v) dv}{ \displaystyle \int_v  h_n(v) dv }.
	\label{eqn:mean}
\end{equation}
The function $h_n(v)$ is a Gaussian function as it is the product of two Gaussian functions, 

\begin{equation}
h_n(v) = e^{-\frac{(v-\mu_{h_n})^2}{2\sigma_{h_n}^2}}, 
\end{equation}
so the right side of equation \ref{eqn:mean} was nothing but $\mu_{h_n}$ and 
in a similar way, we calculate $\sigma_{h_n}$ from the neural data

\begin{eqnarray}
	\mu_{h_n} &\approx& \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} \\
	\sigma_{h_n}^2 &\approx& \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{m} v_m^2 r_{nm}}{\displaystyle \sum_{m} r_{nm}} - \mu_{h_n}^2
	\label{eqn:final_h}
\end{eqnarray}


We know the mean, $v_{g_n}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{g_n}$, of $g_n(v)$ from the molecular volumes of the ensembles of odorants. 
We calculate the mean $\mu_{h_n}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{h_n}$ of $h_n(v)$ from the neural data.
Using them, we calculate the mean $v_n$ and the standard deviation $\sigma_n$ of $f_n(v)$:
first we calculate $\sigma_n$ from 

\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{\sigma_n^2} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2_{h_n}}  - \frac{1}{\sigma^2_{g_n}}
\end{equation}
and then we calculated $v_n$: 

\begin{equation}
	\frac{v_n}{\sigma_n^2}  =    \frac{\mu_{h_n}}{\sigma^2_{h_n}} - \frac{v_{g_n}}{\sigma^2_{g_n}}.
\end{equation}
The calculated $v_n$ and $\sigma_n$ are in the supplemental file volume-profiles.csv. 
The resulting $f_n(v)$ are plotted over the actual data, for \numberofreceptors ORs (Fig.~\ref{fig:vol-res}),
in which p-values $<0.05$. 

We calculated p-values by permutation test, shuffling the data $10^5$ times. 
We shuffled the association between odorants and responses of a given OR,  
and then checked the null and alternative hypothesis. 
The alternative hypothesis is
``{\it The response of ORN depend on the molecular volume of odorants.}'', 
which requires  a finite value for $\sigma_n$, 
and the null hypothesis is 
``{\it The response of ORN is independent of molecular volume of odorants.}'',
which requires $\sigma_n \rightarrow \infty$, 
so p-value is the probability of having $\sigma'_n\leq\sigma_n$, 
where $\sigma_n$ is calculated from the original data, but $\sigma'_n$ is calculated using permuted version. 

We are testing a hypothesis on $\sim$60 ORs simultaneously (just 44 were present in DoOR 1.0). 
If we had used a simple threshold of 0.05 for the p-value of each OR, we could have had many false positives. 
To address this issue of multiple-comparison problem 
we used Bonferroni correction (by multipling p-values by 60). 
The problem with Bonferroni correction is that it may increases false negatives.
This problem can be addressed using another method -- False Discovery Rate (FDR)--  that keeps the rate of false positive below a threshold \cite{benjamini1995controlling,shaffer1995multiple}.
We used both methods -- Bonferroni and FDR, as well as no correction. We used the function \textit{p.adjust} of GNU R to calculate the corrected p-values. 
The result were labeled accordingly in Fig.~\ref{fig:vol-res} and Fig.~\ref{fig:preferred_volume}.

We also wanted to show the diversity of volume and flexibility of binding pocket among ORs.
To estimate the p-values, 
we took any pair of ORs that are sensitive to molecular volume (\numberofreceptors ORs),
calculate their difference, 
use a permutation test ($6\times10^4$ shuffles) and measure the probability of being different only by chance (Fig.~\ref{fig:p-values}).

%Now we know the preferred volume $v_n$ of each receptor and also its flexibility $\sigma_n$.

%but, to be sure, we also put them in a test. 
%After calculating function $f_n(v)$ for each odorant receptor, we can calculate $\psi_{nm}$ of the equation \ref{eqn:factors}.
%If $\psi_{nm}$ is independent of molecular volumes, it means that the assumptions where justified.

The relation between the molecular volumes and the response of ORNs was evident (Fig.~\ref{fig:vol-res}). 
The function $f_n(v)$ could be considered as the tuning curve of OR $n$ in response to molecular volumes (Fig.~\ref{fig:vol-res}). 
Each OR had a preferred molecular volume $v_n$ and shows some flexibility $\sigma_n$. 
The calculated $f_n(v)$s are in  Fig.~\ref{fig:vol-res}. 
It includes \numberofreceptors ORs, 
which showed a significant dependence to molecular volume of odorants in their response (p-value $<0.05$). 

The flexibility of a receptor may affect the broadness of it tuning curve, 
but we did not see any significant relation, 
using three definition of broadness: depth of selectivity, breadth of selectivity and kurtosis \cite{moody1998model,freedman2006experience,muench2015door}.


From the results of \numberofreceptors ORs, 
\bonferroni of them were significant according to Bonferroni correction (OR name in black), 
\fdr of them were significant according to FDR correction (OR name in gray), 
and the rest (\nocorrection ORs, name in light gray), 
only satisfied the criteria of p-value $<0.05$, without any corrections.
Considering the FDR correction, 
more than half of available ORs in DoOR 1.0 (\fdr / 44) showed significant sensitivity toward molecular volumes. 
The rest could be sensitive to molecular volume as well, 
but the current evidence is not enough and more experiments are necessary.

One interesting case in this regard was Or82a; it did not fit to our hypothesis. 
It binds to Geranyl acetate much better than any other molecule. 
When we removed Geranyl acetate from the data, suddenly Or82a became a perfect fit with a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.03 (Fig. \ref{fig:Or82a}). 
This makes the underlying interaction between Geranyl acetate and Or82a, a special case that needs more investigations.

The parameters of $f_n(v)$, $v_n$ and $\sigma_n$ are in Fig. \ref{fig:preferred_volume}.
Figure \ref{fig:preferred_volume} demonstrate that the molecular volume preference of ORs were different (right). 
and the flexibility of ORs were also different (left).
To backup these claims, 
we estimated the p-values of having different volume preference and flexibility for each pairs of \numberofreceptors ORs
(Fig.~\ref{fig:p-values}). 
From all possible 378 pairs, 
when comparing the volume preferences, 
133 had a p-value of less than 0.05, 
this number reduced to 89 after using FDR and further reduced to 32 using Bonferroni correction.
When comparing flexibilities, 
the numbers were 168, 134 and 77 respectively. 
The union of these two set confirmed that 226 (p-value $<0.05$), 171 (FDR corrected), and 91 (Bonferroni corrected) pairs of ORs showed distinct differences in their binding-pocket characteristics.

The diversity of ORs is important in perceiving the quality of smells. 
In a hypothetical experiment, 
assume that every characteristic of odorant molecules are the same except their molecular volume.
If all ORs  have the same preferred volume and flexibility, 
any change in the molecular volume will change only the intensity of smell and not its quality.
Here we showed that ORs  had different preferred volumes and flexibilities, 
so any change in the molecular volume of an odorant results in a different combinatorial encoding which affects the quality of perceived smell as well its intensity.
This is in agreement with the work of M. Zarzo: larger molecules  smell better~\cite{zarzo2011},
and might describe the differences in the smell of methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol. 
Methanol smells pungent, ethanol smells pleasant and winy, propanol and butanol smell like ethanol except butanol has a little banana like aroma.
We suggested that the molecular volume affects the combinatorial encoding, 
and the combinatorial code determines the quality of odorants.

Here we showed that the responses of ORNs are related to the molecular volume of odorants, 
apart from that, it is not clear which other features of molecules are measured by ORs. 
There are many works that try to connect the physio-chemical properties of molecules to the evoked neural response or perceived smells.
But the non-linear volume dependence (Eq. \ref{eqn:factors} and Eq. \ref{eqn:volume-dependence})  
may mask important relations between molecules and neural responses.
When $f_n(v)$ is close to zero, 
the value of $\psi_{nm}$ does not matter. 

We predicted that odorants with a molecular volume on the tails of $f_n(v)$ goes undetected, 
regardless of any other physio-chemical properties that they may have. 
This prediction can be confirmed in further experiments. 

To better study $\psi_{nm}$ of an OR, 
it is better to have many data points and those data points are better to be around the preferred volume of the OR.
But this is not the case in the current data. 
For many ORs, 
most data points are on the tails of $f_n(v)$, which is close to zero.
We suggested the best selection of odorants for each of \numberofreceptors studied ORs 
(see Venn diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:odorant-suggest} and supplemental file proposed-odorants.csv), 
saving time and expenses of future experiments. 

%After gathering enough data, 
%by considering the effect of molecular volume on the response of odorant receptor neurons, 
%one might discover more subtle dependence between other molecular features and neural responses, 
%by investigating $\psi_{nm}$, 
%which otherwise would be masked by this non-linear relation $f_n(v)$.

We also predicted some {\it in-vivo} structural aspects of  the binding-pocket of ORs:
the preferred volume of each OR results from the volume of the binding-pocket,
the flexibility of an OR results from the rigidity or flexibility of the binding-pocket; 
%Therefore, our results provide information about both structural and dynamical properties of odorant receptors in Drosophila. 
These data added some constrains over the 3d structure of ORs, 
which might help the prediction and calculation of 3d structure of these proteins. 

The method of this work can be combined with mutagenesis as well. 
Some genes of an OR are mutated, 
then their response to a selection of molecules are measured and finally the preferred volume and flexibility are calculated.
In this way we can understand which amino acids of the OR contribute to the volume and flexibility of the binding-pocket, 
as well as affecting the function of the ORs.

%% This can be changed. %%  https://bitbucket.org/allaei/odor-receptor-volume/issues/36/
In this work, we have excluded many factors, 
because the nature of the problem is inherently complex and otherwise would not be feasible to study. 
There are many factors that affects the concentration of odorant molecules at the receptors, 
like molecular mass, the method of mixing odorant and air, vapor pressure, solubility in water, sensillum lymph and odorant binding proteins (LUSH) \cite{xu2005drosophila,gomez2013ligands}. 
It is difficult to control them in the current experimental apparatus, 
the model will be very complex with many sets of parameters. 

If we puff an odorant into the air, we will have a mixture of air, vapor and mist, 
the mixture gets to sensilla, 
mixes with sensillum lymph, 
and may get a ride from odorant binding proteins and finally reaches to receptors. 
Two important parameters in this process are vapor pressure and water solubility. 
Vapor pressure puts an upper limit on the concentration of the vapor of a liquid. 
Water solubility puts an upper bound on how much of an odrant can dissolve in water. 
Both are nonlinear, if we are at low concentrations, 
then we can neglect the effect of vapor pressure or water solubility, 
if we are close to the concentrations, 
then the vapor pressure or solubility in water is very important. 
We expect these factors have minimal effect on smaller molecules, 
because they evaporate easily and solve in water well and they might not need the help of odorant binding protein, 
so we can be confident about the lack of response to small molecules more than what we can say about larger molecules. 
Using experimental paradigm like Luciferase Assay \cite{mainland2015human}, 
may provide valuable complementary information to our simple model, 
in this setting the concentrations are accurate but the experiment is {\it in-vitro}.

\section*{Conclusion}

%%% 
We showed that molecular volume was an important factor, 
but not the only one that determined the response of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). 

We hypothesized that this was resulted from the volume of binding-pocket of odorant receptors (ORs) and its flexibility. 
We predicted the actual \textit{in-vivo} volume and flexibility of the binding-pockets of ORs. 
The results are in supplemental file volume-profiles.csv and they can be verified when the 3d structures are resolved, 
or more experimental results are available. 

Now that we know how much of the variance in the response of ORN was resulted from molecular volume, 
it is possible to study the effect of other parameters.

We approximated a molecule with a rigid isotropic sphere of given volume, 
so our model does not say anything about shape \cite{Keller2004, Araneda2000, uchida2000}, 
vibrational mode \cite{Turin,Franco2011,turin2015plausibility}, 
chirality \cite{tirandaz2015dissipative} or many other interesting properties of a molecule.
Actually our method and results are a starting point to the study of other factors. 

An improvement to this model is to include anisotropy of the molecules, 
simply by modeling  them as ellipsoids. 
This will capture more aspects of the molecular shape and may help the inclusion of constitutional isomers. 

Approximating $f_n(v)$ and $g(v)$ with a Gaussian function makes the mathematical formulation simple and readable. 
But a semi-infinite function may be a better choice for molecular volumes can not have negative values.

Although this work was on the data of \textit{Drosophila}, 
we expect that the general principles and methodologies of this work hold for vertebrates as well, 
we are working to apply the same method to data of human olfactory receptors \cite{mainland2015human}.

%There are two main assumption in this work: 
%First we assumed that the response of an OR could be factorized into two terms, 
%according to (\ref{eqn:factors}).
%Second, we assumed that the volume dependence factor $f_n(v_m)$ in (\ref{eqn:factors}) 
%had a Gaussian form (Eq. \ref{eqn:volume-dependence}).
%Considering the physics and chemistry behind the binding-process (Fig. \ref{fig:binding-pocket}), 
%and the neural responses (Fig. \ref{fig:vol-res}), 
%these assumptions were logical. n


%Our work can be improved in many ways, we can consider the anisotropy of molecular shape, and we can improve the approximation of $f_n(v)$. 

%Molecules have complex shapes, 
%in this work we have used the simplest possible approximation, 
%we approximated a molecule with a sphere, 
%kept only its volume and discarded any other spatial complexity. 
%This can be improved by approximating a molecule with an ellipsoid, 
%In this way more spatial details will be taken into account.
