abstract = {We have developed a new computational framework for merging odor response data sets from heterogeneous studies, creating a consensus metadatabase, the database of odor responses (DoOR). As a result, we obtained a functional atlas of all available odor responses in Drosophila melanogaster. Both the program and the data set are freely accessible and downloadable on the Internet (http://neuro.uni-konstanz.de/DoOR). The procedure can be adapted to other species, thus creating a family of "olfactomes" in the near future. Drosophila melanogaster was chosen because of all species this one is closest to having the complete olfactome characterized, with the highest number of deorphanized receptors available. The database guarantees long-term stability (by offering time-stamped, downloadable versions), up-to-date accuracy (by including new data sets as soon as they are published), and portability (for other species). We hope that this comprehensive repository of odor response profiles will be useful to the olfactory community and to computational neuroscientists alike.},
